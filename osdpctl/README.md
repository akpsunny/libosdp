# osdpctl - Tool to create manage and control OSDP Devices

osdpctl is a tool that uses libosdp to setup/manage/control osdp devices. It
also serves as a starting point for those who intend to consume this library.
It cannot be used directly in applications as most of the time a lot more
product specific customizations are needed.
